## üîÑ Pending Issues

### 1. Backend Validation Error Format
**Status:** Minor issue - system fully functional  
**Priority:** Low  
**Assigned to:** Backend team

**Issue:**
Backend returns `HttpMessageNotReadableException` for enum validation instead of structured validation errors.

**Current Response:**
```json
{
  "exception": "HttpMessageNotReadableException",
  "error": "JSON parse error: Cannot deserialize value...",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-25T18:14:53.173713986"
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "validationErrors": {
    "period": "Invalid period. Must be one of: WEEKLY, MONTHLY",
    "currency": "Invalid currency. Must be one of: GHS, USD, EUR, GBP",
    "totalBudget": "Budget amount must be greater than 0"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-07-25T18:14:53.173713986"
}
```

**Impact:**
- Frontend can't show field-specific error messages for enum validation
- Inconsistent error format compared to other validation errors
- Still rejects invalid data correctly - functionality works

**Solution:**
Backend should catch `HttpMessageNotReadableException` and convert to structured validation errors.
